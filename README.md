**Abstract**
Entity matching is the approach of finding different records of the same real-world entity across single or multiple databases or data sources. In this chapter, the theoretical foundations of this approach and how it is applied in various data science tasks will be presented. The chapter will also focus on a specific task that many data science companies in the tourism branch have to face, namely, to correctly map hotel entities across different sources such as review websites or client and internal databases.
